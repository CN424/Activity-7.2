	  <p>The Mindoro State University (MinSU) was originally the Mindoro
	  National Agricultural School (MINAS) created by R.A. 506 as a 
	  national agricultural secondary school in the island of Mindoro. It
	  formally opened Hs doors for learning on August 26, 1951.In 1963, by
	  authority of R.A. 3758 it opened the Collegiate Department. This 
	  steered the offering of several collegiate courses. The first two
	  years leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Agriculture
	  (BSA) was initially offered. This was followed by the two-year 
	  course leading toAssociate in Agricultural Technology (AAT) in 1973,
	  then the complete course offering of Bachelor of Science in 
	  Agricultural Education (BSAE) in1975 and the BSA curriculum 
	  developed by the Technical Panel for Agricultural Education (TPAE)
	  based at Los Ba√±os, Laguna was adopted by the school. This gradually
	  replaced the BSA curriculum as well as the BSAE.The continued 
	  offering of collegiate courses, in addition to the secondary 
	  curriculum which was offered since the founding of the school, made
	  MINAS a full-fledged college hence, the change of name from MINAS to
	  MCAT was approved on June 10, 1976, by then Secretary Juan L. Manuel
	  of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports. It was converted
	  into StateCollege and is now MinSCAT by virtue of R.A. 8007 on May 
	  25, 1995.The leadership of MinSCAT as an educational institution has
	  progressed fromits Superintendent, Mr. Eligio C Ureta, Sr. (1951-
	  1962), to Mr. Onofre F. Martin (1962-1963), Mr. Crispin E. Cabanlla
	  (1963-1965), Mr. Antonio U. Ganir (1965-1979), Mr. Camilo P. Silvest
	  re (1979-1990), Mr. Manolito V. Icalla as Principal-OIC (1990-1991),
	  Mr. Jeremias A. Ortiz as Administrator-OIC (1991-1994), Dr. Angelito
	  A. Bacudo as Principal-OIC (1994-1996). The reorganization of 
	  MinSCAT as a State College through theable leadership of Dr. 
	  Angelito A. Bacudo who was installed as its first President on July
	  8, 1996 paved way for the development of MinSCAT as a He coined the
	  core values, MinSCAT plants RICE; Responsibility, Involvement, 
	  Commitment and Excellence. MinSCAT is the only state college in the
	  province of Oriental Mindoro. By virtue of CMO No. 27, series 2000,
	  the Polytechnic; College of Calapan and the Bongabong College of 
	  Fisheries wereintegrated under her umbrella. With the widening 
	  service area, MinSCAT continues to serve her role as an educational
	  institution for students tobecome globally competitive graduates and
	  change agents responsible in fostering agricultural, fishery and 
	  industrial development. MinSCAT Bongabong Campus originally the 
	  Bongabong School of Fisheries (BSF) wasestablished on September 21,
	  1964, by virtue of Republic Act No. 3306. In 1975, the government 
	  approved the offering of the Revised Fishery Technical Education 
	  Curriculum. It was converted into a full-pledged college as the 
	  Bongabong College of Fisheries (BCF) on July 15, 1995, by virtue of
	  R.A. 8143. MinSCAT Calapan Campus, on the other hand, was 
	  established as a government secondary trade school known as Calapan
	  Schoolof Arts and Trades (CSAT) by virtue of R.A. 3397 in June 1961 
	  but only started operating five years later. In 1972, CSAT merited 
	  the approval of Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports (MECS) to
	  offer trade Technical Education Curriculum. Efforts to convert CSAT
	  into a higher education authorized to offer degree courses were 
	  realized with the approvalof R.A. 8076 on June 19, 1995, converting
	  CSAT to Polytechnic College of Calapan (PCC). With the integration,
	  then PCC has evolved as MinSCAT Calapan City Campus. The Mindoro 
	  State College of Agriculture and Technology,with three campuses with
	  in the two congressional districts of the province,is recognized as
	  the only public institution of higher learning in the province of
